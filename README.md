# Wireless network sensor with LoRaWAN

Wireless network sensor for environment parameters monitoring at the Universidad Tecnologica de Panama using LoRaWAN technology

## Description

This repository contains the code used to implement a wireless sensor network for the Internet of Things, using the LoRaWAN communication protocol. Specifically the code for the microcontroller used, which in this case is a Particle Photon. The example code provided by the LMiC library is used as a base, which presents some basic configurations for the correct use of the library, to this is added the code based on the application.
This project proposes to monitor environmental parameters in the classrooms of the Technological University of Panama, in order to evaluate the performance of students based on the environment where they study. To achieve this purpose, the use of sensors that measure temperature, relative humidity, and light intensity is proposed. In another project, it would be extended to the measurement of air quality and acoustic noise.
